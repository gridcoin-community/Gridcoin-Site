### WSL notes

If you're running through WSL you need to use the flag `--force-polling` with the above command or it will not regenerate automatically on changes.

If you wish to access it from another device you need to use [this workaround](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723). Remember to change the ports that are opened.
