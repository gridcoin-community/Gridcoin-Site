- name: Asteroids@home
  link: https://asteroidsathome.net/boinc/
  goal: Asteroid research - it uses photometric measurements of asteroids observed
    by professional big all-sky surveys as well as 'backyard' astronomers. The data
    is processed using the lightcurve inversion method and a 3D shape model of an
    asteroid together with the rotation period and the direction of the spin axis
    are derived.

- name: NFS@Home
  link: https://escatter11.fullerton.edu/nfs/
  goal: Lattice sieving step in Number Field Sieve factorization of large integers.
    Many public key algorithms, including the RSA algorithm, rely on the fact that
    the publicly available modulus cannot be factored. If it is factored, the private
    key can be easily calculated.

    into RNA and the RNA translated into proteins.'
