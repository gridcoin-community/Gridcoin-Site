- name: Asteroids@home
  link: https://asteroidsathome.net/boinc/
  goal: Asteroid research - it uses photometric measurements of asteroids observed
    by professional big all-sky surveys as well as 'backyard' astronomers. The data
    is processed using the lightcurve inversion method and a 3D shape model of an
    asteroid together with the rotation period and the direction of the spin axis
    are derived.

- name: NFS@Home
  link: https://escatter11.fullerton.edu/nfs/
  goal: Lattice sieving step in Number Field Sieve factorization of large integers.
    Many public key algorithms, including the RSA algorithm, rely on the fact that
    the publicly available modulus cannot be factored. If it is factored, the private
    key can be easily calculated.

  goal: 'The gene@home project is an implementation of the PC-IM algorithm, whose
    purpose is to expand Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Each network is a graph that
    specifies the causal relationships inside this set of genes, and helps in studying
    the gene expression phenomenon: the process through which the DNA is transcribed
    into RNA and the RNA translated into proteins.'
