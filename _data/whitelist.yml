- name: Asteroids@home
  link: https://asteroidsathome.net/boinc/
  goal: Asteroid research - it uses photometric measurements of asteroids observed
    by professional big all-sky surveys as well as 'backyard' astronomers. The data
    is processed using the lightcurve inversion method and a 3D shape model of an
    asteroid together with the rotation period and the direction of the spin axis
    are derived.
