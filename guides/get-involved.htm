			<p>You can help science by helping Gridcoin grow. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, we have no major VC backing and rely entirely on volunteers to spread the word about our awesome project. Here's some ways you can contribute sorted from easy to complex. </p>
			<p>First thing's first, you should get connected with one of our communities online. It's always more fun to work alongside other people than work by yourself. Our discord is our most active online community. Check out the community menu at the top for some places to do that.</p><br>
			<h2>Crunch</h2>
				<p>One of the most popular ways to get involved in Gridcoin is to crunch, which means using your computer's processing power to process data for scientific research. Check out our <a href="/guides/boinc-install.htm">solo crunching guide</a> to get started. </p>
			<h2>Donate</h2>
				<p>If you have GRC or fiat money you can donate, it can go a long way to helping Gridcoin's development and promotional efforts. You can donate GRC to the community wallet <code>bc3NA8e8E3EoTL1qhRmeprbjWcmuoZ26A2</code> (this is a multi-sig wallet whose funds can only be spent upon a network-wide vote). One of the easiest ways to donate is by setting up a sidestake, which means a portion of every stake you make will go to the community wallet. To setup a sidestake</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Go to the hamburger menu (top left of wallet) and select Help -> Debug window -> Console</li>
						<li>Type in the following two commands followed by enter. Be sure to change 5 to the percent you want to donate</li>
						<li><code>enablesidestaking=1</code></li>
						<li><code>sidestake=bc3NA8e8E3EoTL1qhRmeprbjWcmuoZ26A2,5</code></li>
					</ol>
				<p> You can also donate USD, GRC and other crypto to <a href="https://github.com/TheSCInitiative/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ABOINC%2Cgridcoin">bounties</a> funding Gridcoin and BOINC development.
			<h2>Volunteer</h2>
			<h4>Help spread the word online:</h4>
				<p>You can help people learn about Gridcoin online and help amplify the voices of people who are mentioning Gridcoin. Please remember to always be courteous in your online engagements. Nobody likes a spammer, so be sure to respect the rules of wherever you're posting and not come across as one.</p>

			<h5>Reddit links:</h5>
				<p>Recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=gridcoin&sort=new" rel="nofollow">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=gridcoin&type=comment&sort=new" rel="nofollow"">comments</a> related to Gridcoin</p>
				<p>If you subscribe to a few of these subs, they will show up in your reddit feed as a reminder to make a quick comment to others. These are great places to tell people about gridcoin: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpumining/" rel="nofollow">/r/cpumining</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptomining/" rel="nofollow">/r/cryptomining</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/" rel="nofollow">/r/gpumining</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/laptopmining/" rel="nofollow">/r/laptopmining</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/" rel="nofollow">/r/cryptocurrency</a> </p>
				<p>Remember that promoting BOINC project is also a great way to get people involved in science and Gridcoin. For example, you could comment about Asteroids@home on articles mentioning asteroids</p>
			<h5>Content Creators</h5>
				<p>Ask your favorite content creators to do an episode on us or mention us. Comment on their YouTube videos, etc.</p>
			<h4>Help spread the word IRL</h4>
				<p>Gridcoin has a number of <a href="https://github.com/gridcoin-community/Gridcoin-Marketing">posters and other materials</a> you can use to spread the word about Gridcoin in your town, school, or other community.</p>
			<h4>Ask your exchange to list us</h4>
				<p>If you have an account at an exchange with a fiat on-ramp, please ask your exchange to list us. Here's a sample you can pop into their contact form, remember that customizing this will help make a bigger impact:</p>
				<i><p>Dear Exchange,</p>
				<p>I would love if you could add Gridcoin to your lists of coins. It has been around since 2013 and supports scientific research. The wallet uses a similar RPC to Bitcoin so it should be a fairly easy coin to add. Currently, trading Gridcoin requires going to other exchanges and I would rather keep all my trades here. </p>
				<p>Thank you for your consideration,<br>
				YOURNAMEHERE</p></i>

			<h4>If you have design skills</h4>
				<p>Put together some HYPE designs for Gridcoin to attract more people to our project. Just make some designs, submit them to the community for feedback (via discord, reddit, etc) and then send your final versions in to our <a href="https://github.com/gridcoin-community/Gridcoin-Marketing">community promotion repository on Github</a>.</p>

			<h4>If you have programming skills</h4>
				<p>Gridcoin and BOINC could use your help! Gridcoin and BOINC are both coded in C++. There are even a <a href="https://github.com/TheSCInitiative/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ABOINC%2Cgridcoin">number of bounties</a> available for high-priority code contributions. Helping science <i>and</i> getting paid is a sweet deal!</p>
				<p>Here's some ideas that people have brought up which need a developer to take them on. They could be written in your language of choice:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A "one click" miner tool. It would handle all the setup of BOINC/Gridcoin wallet/etc to make it much easier to get started crunching for GRC. </li>
				</ul>
