                            <li> Follow our <a href="/guides/boinc-install.htm">solo crunching guide</a> and attach to one or more BOINC projects. You will need to crunch at least one workunit for a BOINC project. Once you have completed a workunit, you can set the project(s) to "no new tasks" (this option is under advanced view). If you are only installing BOINC so you can get credit for Folding@home (and otherwise have no interest in crunching BOINC projects), the <a href="https://escatter11.fullerton.edu/nfs/">NFS@Home</a> project is known to validate workunits quickly, works on all operating systems, and is a good choice for this purpose. Other projects may validate work slowly, which can delay the time it takes for your beacon to validate/for you to start earning credit for your Folding@home work. Be sure to double-check the project you intend to use is still on the <a href="whitelist.htm">whitelist</a>.</li>
                            <li> Find your CPID, this is a unique identifier assigned to you by BOINC projects. You can find it in the Gridcoin wallet under hamburger menu > settings > researcher wizard > projects.</li>
                            <li> Download the Folding@home client from <a href=https://foldingathome.org>Folding@Home</a> and start installation</li>
                            <li> When prompted, create a username with the format: friendlyname_GRC_CPID. Friendlyname can be any name you want, GRC must remain in the middle and be capitalized, CPID should be your CPID</li>
                            <li> Not required but helps promote Gridcoin: enter team # 226804 when prompted</li>
                            <li> Setting up a passkey is optional but strongly suggested as you will get more F@H credit which means more GRC</li>
                            <li> After you create your folding@home username, it will take up to 48 hours for the Gridcoin network to see it and start awarding GRC</li>
