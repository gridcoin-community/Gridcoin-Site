                    If your wallet.dat file is stolen, and it's unencrypted &amp; you have no backup of the file, it's the equivalent of cash being stolen; there's no way of getting it back unless you catch the thief. Thusly, you must take proper precautions to prevent the loss/theft of your Gridcoin.
