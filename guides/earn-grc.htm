                            Make sure to copy the code on your wallet and not the code above. Each code is different
                        </figcaption>  
                        g) If you press next you should now see the screen below

                        h) Go to BOINC and click a whitelisted project you work on. Click on the Your Account button under Project web pages. If not listed, click on Home page and look for a setting or account options page on the website

                        </div>
                        i) If you see the page below, click on the other account info link. If you see something else, look for a place to change your username
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mb-4" src="/assets/img/guide/boinc-account-overview.png" alt="image what some BOINC account pages look like with the other account info link underlined">
                        j) Change your username temporarily to the code in your wallet until the beacon verifies (takes ~24-48 hours). This proves to the network that you own your account and are not trying to steal rewards from someone
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/boinc-account-username-change.png" alt="image what the name change screen looks like with an example code filled in for the username">

                            Your BOINC project may look different. Don't use the exact code above. Use the code that was in your wallet
                        </figcaption>
                        k) After ~24-48 hours your beacon should validate and you should see something like the screen below. After you see this, you can now change your username to whatever you want
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/valid-beacon-screen.png" alt="image showing the beacon page showing the words everything looks good and a checkmark">

                            l) <u>If locked</u>, unlock the wallet for "Staking Only". It is recommended to have it encrypted for security. 
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-unlock.png" alt="image showing the unlock menu that appears after press the unlock button. Shows 'for staking only' checked and a textbox to enter your password">

                                Screen after the Unlock Wallet button is pressed. Doesn't apply or show as an option if the wallet has not been encrypted

                            m) Run the wallet close to 24/7. When your wallet is off, you miss chances to stake blocks and earn rewards. Make sure you see a green up arrow symbol like below
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-staking.png" alt="image showing a green up arrow being hovered over saying 'staking' and numbers about how likely it is to stake">

                                Your numbers will be different when you hover over the icon. Make sure the icon is green and upward. If it isn't, hover over it to see what issues are going on
                            </figcaption>
                            <p class="mb-4">n) Every 6 months, you will need to renew your beacon. This can be done by pressing the beacon button then clicking on the renew button<p>
                            o) Keep the wallet up to date as updates are released

                <h5 class="text-center">Q: My Wallet Is Not Staking</h5>
                    <li>Hover over the icon with the arrow to see why it is not staking</li>
                    <li>Check that the wallet is unlocked</li>
                    <li>Run the diagnostics under the help tab</li>
                    <li>If you see that your wallet is out of sync, try waiting a few hours leaving the wallet to sync</li>
                    <li>If the "verify clock" test has failed, check that your timezone on your computer is correct and that the time is also correct</li>
                    <li>If you see the ETTS (estimated time to stake) check has failed, consider either getting more coins or following the pool guide</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Balance is Too Low To Send a Beacon</h5>
                    <li>You need around 5000 GRC to stake often while solo mining. If you don't have enough for a beacon, you will not meet this. Consider following the <a href="/guides/pool.htm">pool guide</a> which does not have this requirement, or buying/obtaining 5000 GRC</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Beacon Isn't Being Verified</h5>
                    <li>Make sure you are crunching under your own account in BOINC and that the project is on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a></li>
                    <li>Make sure you changed your username</li>
                    <li>Check if your project is one that requires you to enable stats export
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm#about-gdpr">the whitelist page</a> and see if your project requires it</li>
                            <li>If you see your project requires it, follow the steps to enable it that are linked next to your project</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Try waiting if all of the above are correct and its been less than 48 hours</li>

                    <div class="mb-5 pb-4">
                        <li>
                            Try running the diagnostic (located under the help tab) and check that everything passes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure any projects you crunch are on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a>. If it isn't on it, you will not be rewarded for it
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Check that the CPIDs (cross project identifier) are the same across your project 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If you found differing CPIDs, make sure you are using the same account. If you are on the same account, use <a href="https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@dutch/the-definitive-guide-to-fixing-a-split-cpid-gridcoin-s-and-boinc-s-1-problem">this guide</a> to help fix issues

                        <li>
                            If you just started crunching, you may need to wait around 24-48 hours for statistics to sync

                <li>
                    I) Unlock your wallet fully if you've locked it
                </li>
                <li>
                    II) Run the command <code>advertisebeacon</code> and make note of the <code>verification_code</code>. If you lose track of the code, get it again with <code>beaconstatus</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    III) Login to one of your BOINC projects web pages and change your username to the verification code (you can change it back after your beacon validates)
                </li>
                <li>
                    IV) You can now lock your wallet again (you can unlock your wallet for staking too). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    V) Wait for your beacon to validate (check it with <code>beaconstatus</code>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    VI) Leave your wallet running and unlocked for staking as close as possible to 24/7. This will allow your wallet to stake and earn your rewards
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note: BOINC is needed on the machine running the wallet. It needs to be connected to any project on your account (it can be suspended)
                    If you setup BOINC in a non-default path, add it in the config (see <a href="../guides/gridcoin-install.htm">Step 2</a>)
