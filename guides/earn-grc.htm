                        a) In the wallet, go to the hamburger menu (top left) and then select Settings -> Researcher wizard. Choose Solo ("Beacon" may display as "Action Needed")

                        <figcaption class="text-center mb-4">
                            If your wallet doesn't look like the image above, press the "Start Over" button
                        </figcaption>
                        b) Press next and enter the email you used on your BOINC projects

                        </figcaption>
                        d) Click next and then press the advertise beacon button. The beacon will cost less than 1 GRC to send. If you don't have 1 GRC, go to the previous step to see ways to acquire some for free. If you have GRC but receive an error about an insufficient balance, your transaction your GRC was received during must wait a few minutes to confirm, so try again in 15 minutes.

                        g) If you press next you should now see the screen below

                        h) Go to BOINC and click a whitelisted project you work on. Click on the Your Account button under Project web pages. If not listed, click on Home page and look for a setting or account options page on the website

                        </div>
                        i) If you see the page below, click on the other account info link. If you see something else, look for a place to change your username
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mb-4" src="/assets/img/guide/boinc-account-overview.png" alt="image what some BOINC account pages look like with the other account info link underlined">
                        j) Change your username temporarily to the code in your wallet until the beacon verifies (takes ~24-48 hours). This proves to the network that you own your account and are not trying to steal rewards from someone
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/boinc-account-username-change.png" alt="image what the name change screen looks like with an example code filled in for the username">

                            Your BOINC project may look different. Don't use the exact code above. Use the code that was in your wallet
                        </figcaption>
                        k) After ~24-48 hours your beacon should validate and you should see something like the screen below. After you see this, you can now change your username to whatever you want
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/valid-beacon-screen.png" alt="image showing the beacon page showing the words everything looks good and a checkmark">
                        l) Some projects require you to enable stats exports. If any of yours do, follow the steps for those project to enable it. Currently required by:
                            <ul class="text-center">
                                {%- for project in site.data.whitelist.projects -%}
                                {%- if project.gdpr == "yes" -%}
                                <li class="pt-0"><ul>{{project.name}} (<a href={{project.gdpr-enable-steps}}>steps to enable</a>)</ul></li>
                                {%- endif -%}
                                {%- endfor -%}
                            </ul>

                        <div class="mb-5 pb-2">
                            <p class="text-center"><sup>See the <a href="/wiki/staking.html">staking wiki page</a> for more details on what staking is</sup></p>
                            m) <u>If you locked the wallet (not locked by default)</u>, unlock the wallet for "Staking Only". It is recommended to have it encrypted for security. 
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-unlock.png" alt="image showing the unlock menu that appears after press the unlock button. Shows 'for staking only' checked and a textbox to enter your password">

                            </figcaption>
                            n) Run the wallet close to 24/7. When your wallet is off, you miss chances to stake blocks and earn rewards. Make sure you see a filled in stack of squares in the bottom right like below
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-staking.png" alt="image showing a filled in stack of squares being hovered over saying 'staking' and numbers about how likely it is to stake">
                            <figcaption class="text-center mb-4">
                                Your numbers will be different when you hover over the icon. Make sure the icon is lit and is not red or unlit. If it isn't, hover over it to see what issues are going on. Note that the "average" time to stake is an estimate, sometimes you may stake 5 times more often than "expected" and sometimes you may take 5x as long to stake as "expected".
                            </figcaption>
                            o) <u>Every 6 months</u>, your beacon will renew automatically if your wallet is open and unlocked for staking.
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/beacon-renew.png" alt="image showing a button in the center labeled advertise beacon and text above it saying your beacon is eligible for renewal">

                            </figcaption>
                            p) Keep the wallet up to date as updates are released

                <h5 class="text-center">Q: My Wallet Is Not Staking</h5>
                    <li>Hover over the icon with the arrow to see why it is not staking</li>
                    <li>Check that the wallet is unlocked</li>
                    <li>Run the diagnostics under the help tab</li>
                    <li>If you see that your wallet is out of sync, try waiting a few hours leaving the wallet to sync</li>
                    <li>If the "verify clock" test has failed, check that your timezone on your computer is correct and that the time is also correct</li>
                    <li>If you see the ETTS (estimated time to stake) check has failed, consider either getting more coins or following the pool guide</li>
                  <li>Remember that the ETTS is an <i>average</i> time to stake. For example, if you average expected staking frequency is once per month, some months you may stake 5 times, and other times you may wait 5 months between a stake.</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Balance is Too Low To Send a Beacon</h5>
                    <li>You need around 1 GRC to send a beacon. If you recently received some GRC, you will need to wait a few minutes for the transaction to be confirmed before using that GRC for a beacon.</li>
                    <li>You can use faucets to get free GRC for sending a Beacon: <a href="https://www.gridcoinstats.eu/faucet">Gridcoinstats.eu</a>, <a href="https://gridcoin.ch/faucet">Gridcoin.ch</a>. Our discord is a great place to ask for a few free GRC to get started</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Beacon Isn't Being Verified</h5>
                    <li>Make sure you are crunching under your own account in BOINC and that the project is on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a></li>
                    <li>Make sure you changed your username</li>
                    <li>Check if your project is one that requires you to enable stats export
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm#about-gdpr">the whitelist page</a> and see if your project requires it</li>
                            <li>If you see your project requires it, follow the steps to enable it that are linked next to your project</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>
                            Try running the diagnostic (located under the help tab) and check that everything passes

                        <li>
                            Make sure any projects you crunch are on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a>. If it isn't on it, you will not be rewarded for it

                        <li>
                            Check that the CPIDs (cross project identifier) are the same across your project
