                                            Note: A small balance of GRC is required in order to advertise your beacon (a smart transaction) in the DPOR system.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Temporarily, fully unlock (not for staking only) your wallet to allow for the beacon transaction.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Navigate to the debug console <code>Help | Debug window | Console</code>, enter the command <code>advertisebeacon</code> (Or wait for the beacon to be sent automatically).

                                                    A small outbound smart transaction will be sent from your wallet (this is the beacon).

                                                <li>
                                                    Once you've confirmed that the outbound smart transaction has been sent, you should lock your wallet.

                                            </ul>

                                    Wait until your CPID is included in the next superblock

                                        <li>
                                            There is a single superblock created daily to register new users &amp; update user BOINC stats, so it could take up to 24hrs before your CPID is registered fully.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Navigate to the debug console <code>Help | Debug window | Console</code>, enter the command <code>beaconreport</code>.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            In the output, search for your CPID. If not present, wait until the next superblock. When your CPID is present, continue to the next step.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            If after a several superblocks your CPID is still not present, try advertising your beacon again.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Unlock your wallet for staking only, and upon staking a block you'll receive your BOINC and POS earnings.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Bear in mind, that earnings are dependent on both how much you are owed (from BOINC computation completed) and your Gridcoin balance interest. If you have a low balance, you could stake a block (being rewarded POS+POR) only once every few weeks/months (consider using a pool instead).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Best practice is to continuously stake 24/7 if possible, since you have an opportunity to stake each block (even if your probability is low) and coin age is not considered within the staking probability calculation.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
