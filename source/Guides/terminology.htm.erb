                            BOINC applications, and the BOINC core client, are native-mode programs, so different versions are required for each platform (a 'platform' is the combination of an operating system and a processor type: e.g., Linux/Intel).<br />
                            <br />
                            The BOINC core client is available for common platforms (Windows/Intel, Linux/Intel, Mac OS/X. etc.). BOINC-based projects compile program versions for some or all of these platforms and place them on their servers. Typically, you download the BOINC core client version for your platform. When the core client requests work from the project's scheduling server, the client tells the server its platform, and the server instructs it to download the appropriate program version.<br />
                            <br />
                            This addresses the needs of most BOINC participants, but it's inadequate if:<br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>your computers have platforms not supported by BOINC or by the project;</li>
                                <li>for security reasons, you want to only run executables you have compiled yourself;</li>
                                <li>you want to optimize applications for particular architectures.</li>
                            </ul>
                            To handle these cases, BOINC lets you make the client software yourself, or obtain it from a third party, rather than downloading it from its 'official' source. This applies to both the core client and to project-specific applications.

                            Astropulse is a new type of SETI. It expands on the original SETI@home, but does not replace it. The original SETI@home searches for narrowband signals, as does a conventional AM or FM radio. Astropulse, on the other hand, listens for broader-band, short-time pulses.<br />

                            By attaching to a project, BOINC will download the project's application(s) and at least one task to work on.

A semaphore synchronizes access to the shared-memory segment. To minimize contention for this semaphore, a scheduler can mark a cache entry as 'busy' (and release the semaphore) while it reads the result from the database (to verify that it is still unsent). </td>

                            In computing, FLOPS (or flops) is an acronym meaning FLoating point Operations Per Second. This is used as a measure of a computer's performance, especially in fields of scientific calculations that make heavy use of floating point calculations; similar to instructions per second.
                            <br /><br />
                            One should speak in the singular of a FLOPS and not of a FLOP, although the latter is frequently encountered. The final S stands for second and does not indicate a plural. Alternatively, the singular FLOP (or flop) is used as an abbreviation for "FLoating-point OPeration", and a flop count is a count of these operations (e.g., required by a given algorithm or computer program). In this context, "flops" is simply the plural rather than a rate.

                            Hyperthreading (or Hyper-threading) is Intel's way of allowing two CPUs to exist on one CPU. One CPU is the normal one, the other is a virtual one. Not to be confused with Dual Core.<br />
                            <br />
                            From Wikipedia: Hyper-Threading works by duplicating certain sections of the processor—those that store the architectural state—but not duplicating the main execution resources. This allows a Hyper-Threading equipped processor to pretend to be two "logical" processors to the host operating system, allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously.

The HyperTransport Consortium is in charge of promoting and developing HyperTransport technology. The technology is used by AMD and Transmeta in x86 processors, PMC-Sierra, Broadcom, and Raza Microelectronics in MIPS microprocessors, ATI Technologies, NVIDIA, VIA, SiS, AMD, and HP in PC chipsets, HP, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and IWill in servers, Cray, Newisys, and QLogic in high performance computing, and Cisco Systems in routers. Notably missing from this list is semiconductor giant Intel, which continues to use a shared bus architecture.

                            From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">Wikipedia</a>: A proxy (-server) is a computer that offers a computer network service to allow clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes.

                            Starting with Seti Classic, it had a flaw where it would only download one result, crunch it and upload it again. Yet if the project was offline for a couple of weeks, you couldn't get - and thus crunch more - results.<br />
                            Add-ons to Seti Classic overcame this problem. A central server would download multiple results that were sent out to others.<br />
                            BOINC has its own queue. It can take work from 0.001 days to a maximum of 10 days. This should get your through project related outages without a problem.

                            The daily result quota will determine how many results you can download per 24 hours to your computer.<br />
                            This ammount is set by the project. It's also set per CPU. So if you have a duo-core HT computer, you have 4 times the daily quota.<br />
                            This depends on how many CPUs you set BOINC to use, of course.<br />
                            <br />
                            When your computer is returning only garbage results, which won't validate, you will be deducted one result per result turned in badly.<br />
                            This means you could end up to 1 result/day per CPU. Hopefully before that time you noticed something is wrong already.<br />
                            Do check if you didn't overclock too high, check if your RAM is still allright and always report to the forums of the project you have the problem with, include the error message you got when returning faulty results.<br />
                            <br />
                            Once you fixed your computer and are returning good results again, your quota will double with every result returned correctly.<br />

                            From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>: Remote procedure call is a technology that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space - commonly on another computer, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. That is, the programmer would write essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.<br />
                            <br />
                            It's also used to allow BOINC to communicate with its different parts (daemon, GUI, screen saver) on localhost. The computer's firewall needs to approve of this.

Each request includes a description of the host, a list of completed results, and a request for additional work, expressed in terms of the time the work should take to complete. The reply includes a list of results and their corresponding workunits. For each request involves a number of database operations: reading and updating records for the user account and team, the host, and the various workunits and results. Many instances of the scheduler can run at once (it is implemented as a Fast CGI program run from the Apache web server).

                            From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory">Wikipedia</a>: In computer hardware, shared memory refers to a (typically) large block of random access memory that can be accessed by several different central processing units (CPUs) in a multiple-processor computer system. The issue with shared memory systems is that many CPUs need fast access to memory and will likely cache memory. Whenever one cache is updated with information that may be used by other processors, the change needs to be reflected to the other processors, otherwise the different processors will be working with incoherent data. Such coherence protocols can, when they work well, provide extremely high performance access to shared information between multiple processors. On the other hand they can sometimes become overloaded and become a bottleneck to performance.

As an example, the SETI@home work generator reads digital tapes containing data from a radio telescope, divides this data into files, and creates a workunit in the BOINC database. The work generator sleeps if the number of unsent results exceeds a threshold, limiting the amount of disk storage needed for input files.

This leads to more goods or services per unit of currency, meaning that less currency is needed to purchase them. This carries some downsides. When people expect prices to fall, it causes them to stop spending and hoard money, in the hope that their money will go further later. This can depress an economy.

The lower the number, the more difficult it is to produce a hash value that fits it. Difficulty varies based on the amount of computing power used by miners on the bitcoin network. If large numbers of miners leave a network, the difficulty would decrease. Thus far, however, bitcoin’s growing popularity has attracted more computing power to the network, meaning that the difficulty has increased.

They then convince the rest of the network to confirm only one of the transactions by hashing it in a block. Double spending is not easy to do, thanks to the way that the bitcoin network operates, but it is nevertheless a risk run by those accepting zero-confirmation transactions.

Firstly, it is mathematically difficult to work out what the original input was by looking at the output. Secondly, changing even the tiniest part of the input will produce an entirely different output.

By giving leverage to a trader, the trading exchange is effectively lending them money, in the hope that it will earn back more than it loaned in commission. Leverage is also known as a margin requirement.
