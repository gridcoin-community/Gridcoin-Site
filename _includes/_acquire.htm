                        Before your wallet can do anything, it needs to be synced (the green tick under connections means you are synced)

                    <li>
                        If you don't want to sync from 0, then you can download a snapshot of the blockchain from clicking File -> Snapshot Download or using the <code>-snapshotdownload</code> command line argument
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The snapshot will only bring you up to 80-90% sync. Allow it to continue syncing after the snapshot has been extracted.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you want to apply it directly, you can download the snapshot <a href="https://snapshot.gridcoin.us/snapshot.zip">here</a>.
                                To use this, open the folder (Linux = .GridcoinResearch/, Windows = %appdata%\GridcoinResearch) and delete <b>only</b> the blk00x.dat files, txleveldb folder, and the accrual folder, and copy the files from the snapshot
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        If you are unable to acquire connections to the Gridcoin network, attempt the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Verify you're running the latest version of the Gridcoin client, as there are frequent updates. Updates are posted on the <a href="https://github.com/gridcoin-community/Gridcoin-Research/releases">GitHub Release Page</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Verify that your computer's time is in the correct timezone.

                        In Gridcoin's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, BOINC rewards are given when users stake, along with an additional 10 GRC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since Gridcoin 5.4 you don't have to stake on your own to get BOINC rewards. Instead you can get your rewards by clicking a button and paying a small fee.
                        See <a href="https://gridcoin.us/wiki/faq.html#what-is-manual-reward-claim-mrc">this wiki entry</a> for further details.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For monthly staking, a balance of 5000 GRC is recommended.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rate you are rewarded for your BOINC work is the rate you mint PoS blocks because BOINC rewards are layered on top of these blocks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Note: Your balance does not affect the amount of the payout, only how frequent. You also need to wait around 16 hours before any coins received are able to stake.
