                    <li>
                        After installing and starting the BOINC Manager, you are asked to add a project or use an account manager. Select the 'add a project' radio button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After clicking “Next“ choose a desired project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will be prompted to either create an account or login to an existing one. For some projects (such as World Community Grid) you have to register directly on the homepage of the project. Remember to use the same email address for all BOINC projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will be prompted with a registration confirmation. Once you have pressed the 'Finish' button, a web browser should launch with additional registration fields required. If not, go to the project homepage (you can definitely find it via Google). You have to find the “Your Account” button and press it. The project homepage of a different project can look different, but should have the same functions!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Within the launched web page, enter your username (don't bother with country/post-code) then press OK.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You'll be next be presented with a team search field, search for and join team 'Gridcoin'. Currently, team 'Gridcoin' membership is mandatory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your computer will now be crunching work units for the chosen project within team Gridcoin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat these steps for all projects you want to participate in.
